\section{Introduction}
I am interested in weightlifting data from the Olympic over the past century and powerlifting and strongman data. I am also interested in NBA data. 

question 4, what is the class of each: df was SparkDataFrame and SparkR and df1 was data.frame.
question 5 part b: there was an error that would not allow us to view data because it was not the correct space to view data.
question 6 part b: there was an error because we cannot view data from the data frame area we were requesting.
