\section{My Interests}
My interests primarily lie in exercise physiology and strength and conditioning. I completed my undergrad in Entrepreneurship because I plan on owning a weight training facility after grad school. I love sports and because of that love after high school I began to immerse myself in the niche sports community; power lifting, strongman, weightlifting, Crossfit.I am taking this class under the guise of my mentor Dr. Larson, who has been helping me navigate the Data Analytics Masters Program. I have access to an amazing population and that is recreationallly trained powerlifters and strongmen, because of this I would love to find normalized data for bar velocity among the Bench, Squat, and Deadlift from this population. Many insights could be discovered such as how long it takes a certain sample to acquire a certain power output, etc.
