\section{First Dataset}
This project was really difficult and then really fun when I finally figured out how to do it all. The first table I created was from ESPN and it was a list by rank of NBA players currently sorted by best Player Efficiency Rating. I love the NBA and I love that the future of the NBA seems to be heading towards data analytics so I thought I would practice getting some simple stats from ESPN. I looked at a ton of tutorials before I found one that got the data through inputting the url instead of selecting different CSS tags and that allowed me to create a table. The second data set that I collected was through an API and I used the code "devtools::install_github("abresler/forbesListR")".
\section{Second Dataset}
That code allowed me to install that packages forbesListR. This allowed me to compile a list of NBA franchise valuations for the year 2017. This was interesting to me since it also output expense ratios and marginal revenue. An analysis could be done versus which franchises are optimizing their spending and making it result in an increased valuation.
